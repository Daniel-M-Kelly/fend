## Architecture

* Start server with `npm run start` command
* Cloned repo for starter code.
* .gitignore file - added dist\ folder and .env file to file, removed reference to bower package manager.

## Configs

* Development configuration - webpack.dev.js
* Production configuration - webpack.prod.js
* Production build - `npm run build-prod` generates dist folder for production app
* Dev mode - `npm run build-dev` uses webpack dev server and dev config
