## Functionality
Sections in the index.html are automatically added to the NavBar with their "data-nav" attribute as the link text and their "id" attribute as the reference.

Clicking a Section link in the NavBar will smooth scroll to the section.

Sections with 25% or more visible in the browser window will have their NavBar link highlighted. The sections will also be marked with the the "your-active-class" class that adds the rotating circles.

## Changes from Template

### Index.html
Added a 4th section to demonstrate dynamic building of unordered Navigation list.

### app.js
Created navBar unordered list based on sections in index.html using querySelectorALL.

Used "your-active-class" to style active sections based on intersection observer output

Used window.scroll to smooth scroll to section when clicked on navigation bar, using an event listener and ignoring the default action.

### style.css
Modified the ".navbar__menu ul" style to use a flexbox to organize the nav items into a row, and justify the content.

Created a ".navbar__menu .active__section" to highlight the nav item related to the section that is currently visible in the browser window.
