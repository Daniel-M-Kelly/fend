# Project Architecture
## Architecture

* Start server with `npm run start` command
* Cloned repo for starter code.
* .gitignore file - added dist\ folder and .env file to file, removed reference to bower package manager.
* Used dotenv file for API Key variable
* Used cors package for testing web server on port 8081

## Configs

* Development configuration - webpack.dev.js
* Production configuration - webpack.prod.js
* Production build - `npm run build-prod` generates dist folder for production app
* Production server - `npm run start` runs production node server
* Dev Build - `npm run build-dev` uses webpack dev server and dev config
* Dev Server - `npm run start-dev` uses nodemon to automatically restart node server when files are changed.
* Note: Dev Webserver runs on port 8081

## Content
* HTML File in src/client/views
* 2 Javascript Files
* Styles located in src/client/styles folder

# Functionality

## API

* Used Meaning Cloud Summarization API: https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/summarization
* Note: Only non-authenticated HTTP and FTP url's are supported.
* Ex. URL: http://www.theregister.com/2021/03/03/nvidia_on_arm_licensing_model/
* Use dotenv package to hide API key from client, included the .env file in .gitignore so it wouldn't be posted on public github repo
* API response shows up in results section of page.

## Offline Functionality
* Implemented Service Workers in Prod environment only.

## Testing
* Jest installed, run with command `npm run test` each js file is tested.

## Interactions
* Form checks for valid URL on submit.
